- If you are being focused by an aggressor and cannot fund defense, an early limited territory cession can be welfare-positive versus repeated capped income destruction.
- High upkeep + low damage-to-income conversion makes large standing armies welfare-negative; favor minimal deterrence rather than max militarization.
- When damage per attack is high and defense-destroy factor is large, even small defensive forces can erase attacker mils; hold enough defense mils to make aggression unprofitable.
- In late-game (last 1–2 turns), offensive builds rarely pay back; prioritize welfare and avoid purchases unless they reduce incoming damage.
- If a hegemon emerges, neutral appeasement without deterrence can invite last-turn exploitation; maintain at least a minimal deterrent or negotiate binding compensation early.
