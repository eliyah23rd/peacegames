## Notes & Insights
- Keep this file updated for each user request: add tasks, mark done, and capture notable decisions.
- Skill created at `skills/peacegames/` with runbook in `skills/peacegames/references/commands.md`.
- User asked how to view end-of-round data and world map after a new sim.
- User asked whether the latest sim used fixed-map territories from `worldmap/world_territories_32.json`.
- User ran `python -m run_llm_resource_simulation initial_setup/resource_demo_4p.json --model gpt-5.1 diplomacy,opportunist,austerity,sneaky`.
- User asked where the skills file and TODO are located.
- User requested updating the skill to only require tests when changing .py or data files.
- User reported territory names not matching expected map overlays.
- User noted `world_map_32_internal_labeled.png` has the correct names; likely mismatch between UI JSON cache and updated map assets.
- Root cause: `draw_terrs_v2.py` writes `world_territories_32.json` using default names, not `name_overrides.json`.
- Regenerated `worldmap/world_territories_32.json` after applying name overrides.
- User asked to fit legend data into notice board on the map.
- Added notice-board legend drawing in `peacegame/worldmap_renderer.py`.
- User wants legend moved right, bolder/bright text, and external legend removed.
- Removed map legend from UI to avoid duplicate legend above map.
- User reports map not showing after UI restart; likely cached JS or /api/map failure.
- Fixed syntax error in /api/map logging f-string.
- Added server-side map render logs for debugging.
- User reports map not showing after UI changes; likely cached JS or missing mapLegend element.
- Added `tests/territory_contiguity.json` for fixed-map adjacency matrix edits.
- Updated assignment to avoid swapping away capitals and to stop assigning when stuck.
- Updated tests to reflect that not all territories must be assigned.
- Updated tests to allow assignments beyond initial target counts.
- Updated contiguity overrides file to name -> adjacent list format.
- Added `scripts/ensure_contiguity.py` to enforce two-way contiguity consistency.
- User requested a batch-change phase with no tests or commits; only run the ensure script when asked.
- Latest 1-turn data file used: `round_data/resource_demo_4p_1turn_20260208_105925.json` (BrazilEast adjacency via Kamchatka).
