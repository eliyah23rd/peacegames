# Repository Instructions

## Workflow Requirements

- Before making any code changes, run `python run_all_tests.py` and confirm it passes.
- Update or add tests to reflect the intended change.
- After making changes, keep running `python run_all_tests.py` until all pass.
- For tests that validate incorrect input handling, a caught error counts as a pass.
- When changes are complete and tests pass, create a git commit and push to the configured remote.
